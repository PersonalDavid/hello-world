# hello-world
I know it's lame, but I have to start somewhere

So I'm supposed to write something funny here, merely because no one ever gonna see this except me.
It's fair to say that I'd like to engage in a conversation with the lady sitting in front of me, yet not true because I wouldn't like to chat with her. She's clearly not that bright and I'm craving for some feminin interaction because of my recent break up with my now ex girlfriend.
Terrific.
